Research Repository: Wireless Capsule Endoscopy Bleeding Detection
This repository contains the research paper and the accompanying model developed to predict whether images captured during Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) indicate bleeding. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is specifically designed for image-based classification tasks, to achieve accurate detection.



This project was a collaborative effort led during a research internship:
